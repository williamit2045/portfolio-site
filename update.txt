## Navigation and Deployment Issues Document

### Purpose:
This document serves as a record of the current issues and requirements for the portfolio site. It will ensure future conversations and fixes stay aligned with the progress made so far.

### **Navigation Issue: Dropdown Links Not Working**

#### **Observations:**
1. On mobile devices (e.g., iPhone), the dropdown navigation links do not work.
2. Links in the dropdown cover the header, making the interface cluttered.
3. Dropdown is not user-friendly in its current state.

#### **Proposed Fix:**
1. **Display Navigation Links Across the Top on All Screens:**
   - Even on smaller screens, render the links horizontally across the top rather than in a dropdown.
   - This approach will eliminate dropdown issues entirely.
   
2. **Dropdown Redesign (If Dropdown Must Be Retained):**
   - Change the dropdown layout to display links in **2 rows and 2 columns**.
   - Use a **transparent background** for better visibility.
   - Ensure proper spacing and padding to avoid overlapping with the header.

3. **Ensure Links Are Functional:**
   - Debug the dropdown implementation to ensure `onClick` or `to` properties work as expected.
   - Verify that `react-router-dom` correctly handles navigation in both the desktop and mobile versions.

#### **Action Plan:**
- **Option 1 (Preferred):** Convert navigation to always show links across the top.
- **Option 2:** Fix the dropdown to ensure proper alignment, spacing, and functionality.

### **Deployment Issue: Links Not Working After Deployment**

#### **Observations:**
1. Deployed site loads on mobile devices but navigation links do not work.
2. React Routerâ€™s handling of routing on GitHub Pages seems to be causing a 404 error for non-root paths.

#### **Proposed Fix:**
1. **React Router Configuration for GitHub Pages:**
   - Add a `404.html` file in the `public` directory to redirect all paths to `index.html`.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
       <head>
         <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/" />
       </head>
       <body></body>
     </html>
     ```
   - Re-deploy the site using:
     ```bash
     npm run deploy
     ```

2. **Debugging Navigation Links:**
   - Ensure proper use of `Link` from `react-router-dom` for navigation.
   - Test navigation thoroughly on the deployed site in both desktop and mobile views.

3. **Update DNS Settings for Custom Domain:**
   - Confirm that `CNAME` records for `www.williamteach.pro` point to `williamit2045.github.io`.
   - Wait for DNS propagation to complete.

### **Summary of Current Needs:**
1. **Primary Priority:**
   - Fix navigation links to work across all devices.
   - Ensure links are visible across the top on all screen sizes or redesign the dropdown as specified above.

2. **Deployment Debugging:**
   - Resolve React Router 404 issues for non-root paths on the deployed site.
   - Confirm DNS propagation and HTTPS enforcement for the custom domain.

3. **Improved Mobile Design:**
   - Dropdown redesign or elimination for better user experience on mobile devices.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The site is now live at: [https://www.williamteach.pro](https://www.williamteach.pro) but requires fixes for proper functionality.
- Communication should include updates to this document for better tracking of progress and alignment in future conversations.
